# Partnerships

Converge is a serious, long-horizon initiative. We are intentionally operating
under cover while we harden the foundations, validate core flows, and build
institutional-grade reliability.

If you want to explore partnership, reach out with a concrete flow, an outcome
target, and the constraints that must be honored.

## What makes a good partnership

- A real business flow with measurable leakage or risk
- Clear success metrics (cycle time, approval latency, invoice match, audit)
- Willingness to run a gated pilot with explicit stopping rules
