# Converge Zone - direnv configuration
#
# This file integrates with Nix flakes to automatically load the
# development environment when you cd into this directory.
#
# SETUP (one-time):
# 1. Install direnv: brew install direnv
# 2. Hook into your shell (add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc):
#    eval "$(direnv hook zsh)"  # or bash
# 3. Allow this directory: direnv allow
#
# After setup, your shell will automatically load all tools from
# flake.nix whenever you enter this directory.

# Use the Nix flake development shell
use flake

# Optional: Load .env file if it exists (for API keys, etc.)
