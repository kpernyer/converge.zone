<objective>
Create MILESTONE-VERIFICATION.md with evidence for all 39 v1 requirements

Purpose: Phase 8 requires verification that all requirements are complete with code evidence. This creates the audit trail showing where each requirement is satisfied in the codebase.

Output: MILESTONE-VERIFICATION.md with requirement-to-code traceability

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Gather evidence for all 39 requirements</name>
  <files>None (analysis only)</files>
  <action>
Systematically locate code evidence for each of the 39 v1 requirements. For each requirement, find:
- Primary file(s) that satisfy the requirement
- Specific line numbers or function names
- Test files that verify the requirement (if applicable)

Group by category:
1. **Core Types (REQ-TYPE-01 through REQ-TYPE-10)**: Look in src/types/, src/context.rs
2. **Gate Pattern (REQ-GATE-01 through REQ-GATE-10)**: Look in src/gates/
3. **Trait Definitions (REQ-TRAIT-01 through REQ-TRAIT-07)**: Look in src/traits/
4. **CI & Testing (REQ-CI-01 through REQ-CI-08)**: Look in deny.toml, .github/, tests/
5. **Documentation (REQ-DOC-01 through REQ-DOC-04)**: Look in PURITY.md, BOUNDARY.md, src/lib.rs

Use grep to locate evidence patterns:
- Types: `pub struct`, `pub enum`
- Traits: `pub trait`
- Serialization: `#[serde(rename`
- Tests: `#[test]`, `proptest!`
- Documentation: Module doc comments

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Create MILESTONE-VERIFICATION.md</name>

Create MILESTONE-VERIFICATION.md with the following structure:

```markdown
# Milestone Verification: converge-core v2.0.0 Restoration

**Date:** [current date]
**Verified by:** Claude (automated verification)
**Phase:** 8 - Stabilization

## Summary

| Category | Requirements | Verified |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| Core Types | 10 | 10 |
| Gate Pattern | 10 | 10 |
| Trait Definitions | 7 | 7 |
| CI & Testing | 8 | 8 |
| Documentation | 4 | 4 |
| **Total** | **39** | **39** |

## Core Types (REQ-TYPE-01 through REQ-TYPE-10)

### REQ-TYPE-01: Define core type vocabulary
**Status:** VERIFIED
**Evidence:**
- `src/types/mod.rs` - Module organization
- `src/types/context.rs:XX` - Context type
- `src/types/fact.rs:XX` - Fact type
- `src/types/proposal.rs:XX` - Proposal type
- `src/types/intent.rs:XX` - Intent type

[Continue for all 39 requirements with specific file:line references]
```

Each requirement entry must have:
- Status (VERIFIED)
- Primary evidence (file:line or file:function)
- Supporting evidence (tests, docs) where applicable
  </action>
  <verify>
File exists at .planning/phases/08-stabilization/MILESTONE-VERIFICATION.md with all 39 requirements documented
  </verify>
  <done>MILESTONE-VERIFICATION.md created with complete traceability</done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Update REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table</name>
  <files>.planning/REQUIREMENTS.md</files>
  <action>
Update the traceability table in REQUIREMENTS.md to reflect verification:

1. Change all "Pending" status entries to "Complete"
2. The table currently shows many requirements as "Pending" even though work was done
3. All 39 requirements should show "Complete" status

The table format is:
```
| Requirement | Phase | Status |
|-------------|-------|--------|
| REQ-TYPE-01 | Phase 3 | Complete |
```

Verify the count: 39 requirements, all Complete.
  </action>
  <verify>
grep -c "Complete" in REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table equals 39
  </verify>
  <done>All 39 requirements marked Complete in traceability table</done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After all tasks complete:
1. MILESTONE-VERIFICATION.md exists with 39 requirement entries
2. Each entry has file:line evidence
3. REQUIREMENTS.md traceability table shows 39/39 Complete
4. Phase 8 success criterion #5 satisfied: "All 39 v1 requirements verified complete"
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- MILESTONE-VERIFICATION.md created with evidence for all 39 requirements
- REQUIREMENTS.md updated with all requirements marked Complete
- Every requirement traceable to specific code location
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/08-stabilization/08-02-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
