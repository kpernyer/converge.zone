<objective>
Add comprehensive Nine Design Tenets and Purity Declaration documentation to lib.rs.

Purpose: Fulfill REQ-DOC-03 (purity declarations) and REQ-DOC-04 (nine tenets documented). Users reading crate docs will understand the architectural axioms that converge-core enforces.

Output: Enhanced lib.rs with formal documentation sections that serve as the canonical reference for Converge's design philosophy.

  <name>Task 1: Add Nine Design Tenets section to lib.rs</name>
  <files>converge-platform/converge-core/src/lib.rs</files>
  <action>
Add a new `# Design Tenets` section to lib.rs crate-level docs, after the existing `## Guarantees` section. Structure:

```rust
//! # Design Tenets
//!
//! Converge is built on nine non-negotiable design tenets. These are axioms
//! that `converge-core` exists to encode, enforce, and protect.
//!
//! ## 1. Explicit Authority
//!
//! **Axiom:** No defaults that grant authority. Authority is always explicit, typed, and traceable.
//!
//! **Why:** Implicit authority leads to security holes and audit gaps.
//!
//! **In code:** [`AuthorityGrant`] has `pub(crate)` constructors — external code cannot
//! create arbitrary authority. All promotion requires explicit grants.
//!
//! ## 2. Convergence Over Control Flow
//! ...
```

For each tenet (9 total from PROJECT.md):
1. Explicit Authority
2. Convergence Over Control Flow
3. Append-Only Truth
4. Agents Suggest, Engine Decides
5. Safety by Construction
6. Transparent Determinism
7. Human Authority First-Class
8. No Hidden Work
9. Scale by Intent Replication

Include for each:
- **Axiom** statement (1 sentence)
- **Why** it matters (1 sentence)
- **In code** reference to relevant types/traits

Link to concrete types where applicable (AuthorityGrant, Fact, PromotionGate, TraceLink, etc.).
Do NOT use `ignore` or `no_run` code examples - use type references with brackets instead.

  <name>Task 2: Add Purity Declaration section to lib.rs</name>
  <files>converge-platform/converge-core/src/lib.rs</files>
  <action>
Add a `# Purity Declaration` section to lib.rs crate-level docs, after the Design Tenets section. Structure:

```rust
//! # Purity Declaration
//!
//! `converge-core` is pure by design: no I/O, no runtime behavior, no implementation
//! logic — only types, traits, and promotion gates.
//!
//! ## Why Purity Matters
//!
//! - **Portability**: Compiles to WebAssembly, embedded, native
//! - **Testability**: Deterministic, no mocking infrastructure
//! - **Stability**: No external runtime dependencies
//!
//! ## Allowed Dependencies
//!
//! | Crate | Purpose | Why Allowed |
//! |-------|---------|-------------|
//! | thiserror | Error derive macros | Pure, compile-time only |
//! | serde | Serialization traits | Pure, no I/O |
//! | serde_json | JSON types | Structured content only |
//! | tracing | Instrumentation facade | No subscriber in core |
//! | strum | Enum derives | Pure, compile-time only |
//! | typed-builder | Builder derives | Pure, compile-time only |
//! | hex | Hex encoding | Pure utility |
//!
//! ## Forbidden Dependencies
//!
//! | Category | Examples | Why |
//! |----------|----------|-----|
//! | Async runtimes | tokio, async-std | Implies execution |
//! | HTTP/Network | reqwest, axum | Implies I/O |
//! | Parallelism | rayon | Runtime concern |
//! | Randomness | rand | Non-deterministic |
//! | LLM execution | burn, llama-cpp | Implies inference |
//!
//! See [`PURITY.md`](../PURITY.md) for the complete policy and enforcement details.
//! These constraints are enforced by `deny.toml` and CI.
```

Reference PURITY.md for full details. Keep lib.rs section concise (summary tables, not exhaustive lists).

  <name>Task 3: Audit and fix doc examples</name>
  <files>converge-platform/converge-core/src/lib.rs</files>
  <action>
Audit the Quick Start example in lib.rs:
1. Check if the example compiles with `cargo test --doc -p converge-core`
2. If it fails:
   - Add `ignore` if the example requires runtime crate features not in core
   - OR fix the example to use only converge-core types
   - OR convert to prose explaining the pattern without runnable code

The existing Quick Start uses Engine, Context, ContextKey, SeedAgent, ReactOnceAgent.
These ARE in converge-core, so the example should work. If it doesn't compile:
- Check imports are correct
- Check types exist in the public API
- If types are internal/deprecated, update example to use current API

If doc tests pass already, document this in the SUMMARY as "doc examples verified".
  </action>
  <verify>
Run `cargo test --doc -p converge-core` in converge-platform directory.
Expected: All doc tests pass OR are marked with appropriate ignore/no_run.
  </verify>
  <done>Doc examples either compile or are appropriately marked with ignore/no_run with explanatory comments.</done>
</task>

All checks pass from converge-platform directory:
1. `cargo doc --no-deps -p converge-core` builds without warnings
2. `grep -c "# Design Tenets" converge-core/src/lib.rs` returns 1
3. `grep -c "# Purity Declaration" converge-core/src/lib.rs` returns 1
4. `cargo test --doc -p converge-core` passes
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- lib.rs has formal Nine Design Tenets section with all 9 tenets documented
- lib.rs has Purity Declaration section with ALLOWED/FORBIDDEN tables
- cargo doc builds without warnings
- Doc tests pass or have appropriate annotations
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/07-documentation/07-01-SUMMARY.md`
