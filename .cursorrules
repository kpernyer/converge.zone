# Cursor Rules (Repo-Level)

- Treat SSE boxing as a runtime adapter trade-off, not a core design flaw.
- Keep trait objects confined to plugin/registry boundaries where types are
  unknown at compile time.
- Prefer zero-cost, statically typed design in converge-core; allow boxing in
  converge-runtime only when it simplifies transport adapters.
- `Box<dyn StreamingCallback>` is preferred when single-owner; use `Arc` only
  for shared callbacks.
